üõ†Ô∏è Debian-Driver Resolver 0.3
Created by Hawkeye (Team Hawkeye)
The ultimate driver fixer for Kali & Debian-based systems.

"Why troubleshoot drivers manually when you can fix them like a hacker?"

‚ö° What It Does
debian-driver-resolver.sh intelligently detects and fixes common driver issues for:

‚úÖ GPU (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel integrated, and other generic GPUs)

‚úÖ Wi-Fi (Supports Intel, Atheros, Realtek, Broadcom chipsets via common firmware)

‚úÖ Bluetooth (For both USB and onboard chipsets)

‚úÖ Audio (Ensures PulseAudio and ALSA utilities are correctly configured)

‚úÖ USB & Peripheral Devices (Resets USB controllers to resolve connectivity issues)

‚úÖ Works seamlessly on Kali Linux, Debian, and most Debian-based distributions.

üß† Features
Comprehensive Hardware Detection: Automatically scans your system to identify installed Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Audio, GPU, and USB hardware.

Dynamic CLI UI: Clean, colored command-line interface with an animated progress bar for visual feedback.

Intelligent Menu: Presents a menu tailored to your detected hardware, showing only relevant fix options.

Flexible Fix Options: Choose to "Fix All Detected Devices" for a comprehensive solution or select individual components.

Safe & Non-Destructive: Designed to install missing firmware and services without breaking existing configurations.

Automatic Repository Setup: Ensures contrib, non-free, and non-free-firmware APT sources are enabled for full driver access.

Fully Offline Executable: Once dependencies are installed, the core script can run without an internet connection (though initial apt update and package installations require it).

üöÄ How to Use & Workflow
üü¢ Run Directly (1-liner):
For a quick start, copy and paste this command into your terminal:

curl -s [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sadmanadib33/Debian-Driver-Resolver/main/debian-driver-resolver.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sadmanadib33/Debian-Driver-Resolver/main/debian-driver-resolver.sh) | sudo bash

Note: The sudo is crucial as the script requires root privileges for system modifications.

üõ†Ô∏è Or Clone Manually:
For more control and to inspect the code, clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/sadmanadib33/Debian-Driver-Resolver.git](https://github.com/sadmanadib33/Debian-Driver-Resolver.git)
cd Debian-Driver-Resolver
chmod +x debian-driver-resolver.sh
sudo ./debian-driver-resolver.sh

Script Workflow & Steps:
Once you run the script, here's what you'll experience:

Banner Display: A stylish ASCII banner (if figlet is installed, otherwise a simple text banner) will greet you.

Initial System Preparation:

The script checks for and enables contrib, non-free, and non-free-firmware repositories in your /etc/apt/sources.list.

It then runs sudo apt update to refresh your package lists, ensuring access to the latest drivers and firmware.

Hardware Detection:

The script intelligently scans your system for connected devices: Wi-Fi adapters, Bluetooth modules, Audio devices, GPU (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, or generic), and USB controllers.

It will print a summary of detected hardware, letting you know what it found.

Dynamic Menu Presentation:

Based on the detected hardware, a personalized menu will be presented. You'll only see options relevant to the devices found on your system (e.g., if no Bluetooth is found, the "Fix Bluetooth" option won't appear).

An option to "Fix All Detected Devices" is always available for a comprehensive fix.

Driver Installation/Repair:

Select your desired option (e.g., "Fix Only Wi-Fi Drivers" or "Fix All Detected Devices").

The script will proceed to install necessary firmware and packages using apt.

You'll see a progress bar and clear messages indicating the status of each operation.

For some fixes (like Wi-Fi module reloading or PulseAudio restart), the script attempts to apply changes immediately.

Reboot Recommendation:

After significant driver changes (especially for GPU drivers), the script will strongly recommend a system reboot to ensure all modifications take full effect.

Exit: Choose the "Exit" option to gracefully close the script.
